currently based chicago teaches html css ruby rails visual design ux design people world come starter leaguewhich hosted popular community coworking space learn code design develop web apps inperson classes quite intensive ranging meeting days per week hours time ill taking ux design class next three months blogging experience week purpose capture like go knowing nothing building something valuableto fully describe learning process student participating starter league learning ux design scratch first swag seriously delightful stuff nothing better getting swag actually want wear use lets honest probably living hoodie came course framework list topics going discussing next three months course framework topics well explore class sketching usability assessment project planning vision field research user models like personas mental models product features content planning information architecture user flows site maps interaction design wireframes basic visual design usability testing seriously though idea half stuff means thats part joy learning experimentdiving area know nothing hopefully coming side amazing ux knowledge get warnings beginning class careful assume everyone target user dont incorporate peoples feedback without thinking first dont let people talk idea havent finished baking yet last piece advice personal favorite quick let others talk us potentially great ideasprobably little bit insecure inside whether ideas good super bright teacher carolyn chandler said hard people change anticipate need especially show something thats different normally things negative feedback means immediately go back drawing board lesson understood point weve skirting around main question design contrary popular belief im learning design equal graphics although graphics also important elements design look feel create also choices make make design starts concept level first begin create solution problem beyond design design thinking adds another layer combines empathy context problem faced creativity generation insights solutions rationality analyze fit solutions context thats mouthful essentially im learning great design thinking involves people see also interact create go solving problems designing better solutions words user experience design isnt paintbynumbers type process rather way thinking considers tasks goals motivations person expected use particular product reviewing basic definitions design design thinking ux went really fun stuff im going call part every class required doodle thats right learned importance sketching important ux design process sketching usually shortest distance thought visual expression thought given first assignment could redesign airport security would look heres came loved exercise often complain broken things arelike airport security financial systems politics even smaller things feels like always complaining microwave doesnt heat food fast enough salt shaker pours much never find im looking quickly local grocery store im beginning love ux design solutionsoriented aesthetics solving realworld problems beautifully simply creating unforgettable experiences imagine airport security fun experience maybe cantbut sitting room three hours bunch aspiring ux designers know sure inspiring way approach worlds problems final portion class began talking conducting heuristic evaluations get complicated basically heuristic evaluation fancy way saying youre going use experiencebased techniques solve problems learn words trial error ideally start trial error process test potential solutions user experience problem decent knowledge products purpose objectives audience supported user tasks technical environmental constraints trial error isnt always efficient process ever understanding basics help limit scope youre going test end whole point heuristic evaluation build welldesigned system contains elements sites purpose apparent valuable current state obvious know whats going land next steps clear relevant interactive elements fun use actions take immediate powerful effects elements surprise delight every never made feel stupid last one personal favorite im feeling stupid apparently jakob nielsen king heuristics ux community basically hes walking genius usability heuristics commonly used set ux evaluations visibility system status whatever youre building youve got keep people informed whats happening behind scenes long something going take otherwise theyre going pissed maybe never come back site heres good example clearly see bar showing far along backup progress bar know process working go something else files backed relevance familiarity system speak users language words phrases concepts familiar user rather obscure systemoriented terms example youre flight booking site would incredibly awkward see calendar appear way much different one graphic people used processing things calendar keeping certain elements users would expect opposed going crazy design sake aesthetics youre likely get users want control freedom users free explore system without afraid anything bad happen instance tell isnt one favorite features gmail possibly best mail feature planet gmail done incredible job giving users control freedommaking experience customizable also enabling tools like one help reduce fear anything bad happening like hitting reply instead reply eek 5 error prevention theres nothing better using something carefully designed prevent problems might face user occurring first place examples youve got love features annoyingembarassing mean send attachment forget actually attach something gmails forget attachment message great job making users feel like idiots jury still iphones autocorrect feature though cant decide yet done harm good texts emails send phone design consistency users wonder whether different words situations actions mean thing follow existing conventions applicable design consistency allows users transfer existing knowledge new tasks learn new things quickly focus attention tasks basically avoids frustrating people unnecessarily design recognition rather recall minimize users memory load making objects actions options visible user remember information one part dialogue another example much better experience go book flight airport codes autopopulate begin typing destination city visible information choices reduce users mental workload since users recognize command easily recall design former rather latter flexibility customization let users customize save frequent actions personal preferences settings saves time frustration search enter things examples left see infamous search options mac right screenshot one favorite apps buster happen live chicago take public transportation app musthave see allow save favoritesbuses trains take frequently dont organic search every single day said warned fall trap making easy users customize experiences sometimes thats designers way avoiding decisionmaking process customizable finally aesthetic minimalist design eliminate information elements irrelevant rarely needed every extra unit information dialog competes relevant units information diminishes relative visibility short keep things simple dont take away things people need looking also know dont need every single feature available users simplicity king fewer distractions likely nudge users

unproven weight loss program gave away chose people couple conditions would give us feedback tell friends worked loved understand product isnt perfect stage lasted around months got formal beta charged got feedback theres big difference people pay something versus nothing weight loss paying actually important means people taking seriously finally increased regular price 2900year price increased time learned pilot looking launch lower cost versions retrofit one significant mistakes entrepreneurs make underpricing products product great works people pay really easy lower price hard raise price wanted premium priced product people pay us monthly month thats less nutrisystem jenny craig billion businesses less personal trainer costs year didnt randomly pick number asked people currently paying weight loss systems twothirds people country overweight looking lose weight given point time dont need every customer need enough build business think entrepreneurs go free cheap way

designthinking human centered design process employed great effect part design thinkers arsenal yes behavior design like lot great theories equations simple mechanics capable quickly exploding beyond linear explanation considered practice explored application first ill tackle behavior model unpack three elements behavior ill followup explanation basics bjs fogg behavior theory envelopes model quite nicely finally leave handful soundbites food thought behavior model bj says behavior happens three things converge moment behavior happen least one element missing key says put hot triggers path motivated people behavior motivation ability trigger lets unpack formula reverse triggers trigger simply many us label call action also call triggers prompts cues trigger mechanism precipitates act easy enough motivation heres go astray large spend altogether much time attempting influence move motivation levels efforts meant appeal elicit spikes someones motivation otherwise known marketing advertising promotions work tirelessly appeal customers points pleasure pain inspire hope spike fear intimate social acceptance rejection ability motivation slippery construct dr fogg proposes time better spent designing attention ability words simplifyingmaking things easier doyields desired outcomes results attempting convince audience care care comes behavior design equation ability motivation youll see motivation ability xy axes behaviors dynamically fall along ability continuum extending hard easy heres example easier make donation president obamas reelection campaign online drive house pennsylvania avenue motivation affecting behavior also visualized along spectrum dynamically ranging low high im obama fan boy know motivation sky high im leader local tea party im likely motivated benevolent obamas campaign consider motivation ability together triggering behavior someone cares easy likely produce desired outcome ive signed emails barack obama ive given indication motivation level pretty high right get email following president obamas weekly address campaign team recaps address key points weaves donation request thats easy act likelihood engaging act goes contrast received email following presidents address instead asks im exponentially less likely make donation dont ability make gift youve probably noticed obama campaign example theres tradeoff motivation ability thats visualized near degree slope xy axes dr fogg calls slope activation threshold area indicates place triggers succeed put another way thats market marketers looking people motivation ability asking havent thought market along dimensions context behavior design equation pretty helpful consider email received barack obama campaign instead underscoring salient points weekly address tying need donation lets say email promoted video address subsequently saved solicitation video case likelihood behavior occurring much lower even though may motivation fiscal ability make gift perhaps im able play video device riding quiet metra car maybe didnt time watch video example demonstrates possibility trigger ambiguous broad unable adequately drive desired end result fogg behavior theory certainly simple equation becomes much complex practice interesting experience waves understanding come go throughout first day bootcamp definitely points felt handle approach times

shortcut get lost also cause lose customers simplicity hard simplicity changes behavior insist simplicity takeaways synthesizing thoughts blog series working way notes handouts forced organize behavior design bootcamp material way im still collecting thoughts means ive got little bit share eight behavior design takeaways takeaways center around using reinforcement shape behavior karen pryor author dont shoot dog text used studies bootcamp succinctly describes reinforcer anything occurring conjunction act tends increase probability act occur reinforcers course everywhere use day every day last points list explore related axioms foster environment praisebased reinforcement people starved success even successful among us starved feeling successful respond positive reinforcement customers likely hold high standard push days without letting jumping one task another effort measure selfimposed standard bj found feeling created winning even inconsequential disproportionately greater size accomplishment hardwire sequential progressive positive reinforcement products make someone feel like million bucks almost reinforcing facilitating celebration something consequentially quite small celebration frees people creates capacity continue toward desired outcome celebration builds motivation naturally motivation wave naturally peaks sinks troughs celebration close surefire means increasing movation day client asked get team want train motivated train theres simple answer identifying motivate paper tiger good start sole focus creating motivation treats motivation solely outcome instead element behavior design method outcome use praisebased reinforcement congratulations although research conducted bj shows brain recognizes even disingenuous congratulations effective reinforcement received computers people routinely giving outofcontext congratulations eventually condition users resent reinforcer lose capacity reinforce familiar principle interpersonal situations sales guy whos doting matter context occasion dude whos constantly pandering sucking vcs choose contextually appropriate praisebased reinforcement instead ration reinforcement psychologists call variable schedule reinforcement psychological researchers found variable schedule far effective maintaining behavior contstant predictable schedule reinforcement everything app product constantly reinforces user condition customer behavior increasingly minimal perfunctory winning time isnt really winning thus rataionale gamification uncertainty big opportunity know feeling get test question

design funny word people think design means looks course dig deeper really works steve jobs took first starter league class user experience ux design arent already familiar starter league rad school currently based chicago teaches html css ruby rails visual design ux design people world come starter leaguewhich hosted popular community coworking space learn code design develop web apps inperson classes quite intensive ranging meeting days per week hours time ill taking ux design class next three months blogging experience week purpose capture like go knowing nothing building something valuableto fully describe learning process student participating starter league learning ux design scratch first swag seriously delightful stuff nothing better getting swag actually want wear use lets honest probably living hoodie came course framework list topics going discussing next three months course framework topics well explore class sketching usability assessment project planning vision field research user models like personas mental models product features content planning information architecture user flows site maps interaction design wireframes basic visual design usability testing seriously though idea half stuff means thats part joy learning experimentdiving area know nothing hopefully coming side amazing ux knowledge get warnings beginning class careful assume everyone target user dont incorporate peoples feedback without thinking first dont let people talk idea havent finished baking yet last piece advice personal favorite quick let others talk us potentially great ideasprobably little bit insecure inside whether ideas good super bright teacher carolyn chandler said hard people change anticipate need especially show something thats different normally things negative feedback means immediately go back drawing board lesson understood point weve skirting around main question design contrary popular belief im learning design equal graphics although graphics also important elements design look feel create also choices make make design starts concept level first begin create solution problem beyond design design thinking adds another layer combines empathy context problem faced creativity generation insights solutions rationality analyze fit solutions context thats mouthful essentially im learning great design thinking involves people see also interact create go solving problems designing better solutions words user experience design isnt paintbynumbers type process rather way thinking considers tasks goals motivations person expected use particular product reviewing basic definitions design design thinking ux went really fun stuff im going call part every class required doodle thats right learned importance sketching important ux design process sketching usually shortest distance thought visual expression thought given first assignment could redesign airport security would look heres came loved exercise often complain broken things arelike airport security financial systems politics even smaller things feels like always complaining microwave doesnt heat food fast enough salt shaker pours much never find im looking quickly local grocery store im beginning love ux design solutionsoriented aesthetics solving realworld problems beautifully simply creating unforgettable experiences imagine airport security fun experience maybe cantbut sitting room three hours bunch aspiring ux designers know sure inspiring way approach worlds problems final portion class began talking conducting heuristic evaluations get complicated basically heuristic evaluation fancy way saying youre going use experiencebased techniques solve problems learn words trial error ideally start trial error process test potential solutions user experience problem decent knowledge products purpose objectives audience supported user tasks technical environmental constraints trial error isnt always efficient process ever understanding basics help limit scope youre going test end whole point heuristic evaluation build welldesigned system contains elements sites purpose apparent valuable current state obvious know whats going land next steps clear relevant interactive elements fun use actions take immediate powerful effects elements surprise delight every never made feel stupid last one personal favorite im feeling stupid apparently jakob nielsen king heuristics ux community basically hes walking genius usability heuristics commonly used set ux evaluations visibility system status whatever youre building youve got keep people informed whats happening behind scenes long something going take otherwise theyre going pissed maybe never come back site heres good example clearly see bar showing far along backup progress bar know process working go something else files backed relevance familiarity system speak users language words phrases concepts familiar user rather obscure systemoriented terms example youre flight booking site would incredibly awkward see calendar appear way much different one graphic people used processing things calendar keeping certain elements users would expect opposed going crazy design sake aesthetics youre likely get users want control freedom users free explore system without afraid anything bad happen instance tell isnt one favorite features gmail possibly best mail feature planet gmail done incredible job giving users control freedommaking experience customizable also enabling tools like one help reduce fear anything bad happening like hitting reply instead reply eek 5 error prevention theres nothing better using something carefully designed prevent problems might face user occurring first place examples youve got love features annoyingembarassing mean send attachment forget actually attach something gmails forget attachment message great job making users feel like idiots jury still iphones autocorrect feature though cant decide yet done harm good texts emails send phone design consistency users wonder whether different words situations actions mean thing follow existing conventions applicable design consistency allows users transfer existing knowledge new tasks learn new things quickly focus attention tasks basically avoids frustrating people unnecessarily design recognition rather recall minimize users memory load making objects actions options visible user remember information one part dialogue another example much better experience go book flight airport codes autopopulate begin typing destination city visible information choices reduce users mental workload since users recognize command easily recall design former rather latter flexibility customization let users customize save frequent actions personal preferences settings saves time frustration search enter things examples left see infamous search options mac right screenshot one favorite apps buster happen live chicago take public transportation app musthave see allow save favoritesbuses trains take frequently dont organic search every single day said warned fall trap making easy users customize experiences sometimes thats designers way avoiding decisionmaking process customizable finally aesthetic minimalist design eliminate information elements irrelevant rarely needed every extra unit information dialog competes relevant units information diminishes relative visibility short keep things simple dont take away things people need looking also know dont need every single feature available users simplicity king fewer distractions likely nudge users interact whatever created way want next week

youre building look experience controversial founders look young people work startup youre already working hours week cant spend much time learning curve teaching someone work theyre recently college lot people retrofit management team 40s theyve made lot mistakes know get things done interview experience also passion shared sense values youve done startups retrofit right first startup make leap working someone elses company building idea internetbased recruiting sounds obvious wasnt knew internet going great connecting people showed boss intuit time said get funded think met vcs silicon valley close giving come kellogg business school student debt keeping fulltime job met vc named brad feld shared vision recruiting going go online firm gave us 500k condition quit job quit took

young age excuse becoming expert regardless age builds credibility team customers investors media entrepreneurs often focus much product product path customer starts customer one hardest things b2c entrepreneurs struggle building audience whats advice building right audience ill use retrofit example built product theory knew work people lose weight needed take idea road going spend money unproven weight loss program gave away chose people couple conditions would give us feedback tell friends worked loved understand product isnt perfect stage lasted around months got formal beta charged got feedback theres big difference people pay something versus nothing weight loss paying actually important means people taking seriously finally increased regular price 2900year price increased time learned pilot looking launch lower cost versions retrofit one significant mistakes entrepreneurs make underpricing products product great works people pay really easy lower price hard raise price wanted premium priced product people pay us monthly month thats less nutrisystem jenny craig billion businesses less personal trainer costs year didnt randomly pick number asked people currently paying weight loss systems twothirds people country overweight looking lose weight given point time dont need every customer need enough build business think entrepreneurs go free cheap way soon assuming course great product retrofit highly personalized weight loss program personalization sometimes hard scale measure quality control bring new weight loss health experts board retrofit clearly isnt scalable software company trying think part reason outcomes good personalization company quality control important built business beginning practitioners go retrofit university learn way things process developed advisory board pass test give two clients start wait see two clients get feedback goes well give experts full load clients also background checks monitor progress datadriven know given point practitioner system gets point self corrects thats know culture actually working thats dna company takes hold would argue building great culture one important parts job advice entrepreneurs regarding funding funding tactic means end entrepreneurs see victory raising money easy part building actual business hard part raising money like getting loan bank like debt said sometimes cant build business without significant amount capital entrepreneur raising money first thought come think market team comes point need money first person need look remember raising money

real food beg borrow steal resources anything get far possible raise money tap go friends family ultimately theyre backing assess much take money venture capital last stop expensive kind money terms come quite severe professional investors personal job stewards peoples money money friends family ive learned hard way dont want take checks small smaller check important money person ive told every single person invested need prepared never see money people putting checks high maintenance wind spending lot time investor relations value add things ive learned theres lid every pot conviction idea youve made progress find money theres much capital good idea networking pitching thousand times finding investors personal connection youre creating youve used angellist advice entrepreneurs thinking using posted angellist one first rounds sure enough got checks form people vcs true angels great efficient way get word didnt post angel list launched probably wouldnt recommend prelaunch dont want give anyone much heads youre effective channel postlaunch reference check angels interested investing way though ask theyve invested past months would go ceos startups invested ask feedback angels dont eager take someones money youre bed investor vc board member employee hard get make sure research strategies productive efficient big part balancing everything maniacal priorities important part

must converge cause behavior motivation ability triggers using startups fortune companies products alike case fodder bj shared approach mapping target behaviors key prioritizing stepbystep process designing testing solutions reserved students enrolled stanford left san francisco fouryearold daughter ellie instructed dad soon youre back conference want know names new friends thats new thing always wants know names new friends obligation ellie notwithstanding im thrilled able share learnings technori community look forward serving insights realtime application relevant engineers designers founders alike go behavior design bootcamp day one ten us bj settled around large table dining room bjs guest home short introductions indepth explanations would come later dove right first exercise entire day spent becoming familiar bjs behavior theory understanding behavior human nature learning successful designing impact bj made clear outset point day one learn understand apply behavior works would required deliver diagrammed explanation model group exactly two minutes make happen spent day working individual exercises partner activities group projects delivery model design thinking think makes sense call attention distinction dr foggs behavior theory emerging discipline behavior design widening concept design thinking mind occupy similar space mutually exclusive competing thought architectures bj briefly discussed design thinking behavior design relate one another admittedly arrived definitive relationship though believes complimentary im hopeful dr fogg willing ongoing conversation relationship work design community develop framework behavior design design thinking successfully leveraged together held comparison behavior design fits quite nicely larger designthinking human centered design process employed great effect part design thinkers arsenal yes behavior design like lot great theories equations simple mechanics capable quickly exploding beyond linear explanation considered practice explored application first ill tackle behavior model unpack three elements behavior ill followup explanation basics bjs fogg behavior theory envelopes model quite nicely finally leave handful soundbites food thought behavior model bj says behavior happens three things converge moment behavior happen least one element missing key says put hot triggers path motivated people behavior motivation ability trigger lets unpack formula reverse triggers trigger simply many us label call action also call triggers prompts cues trigger mechanism precipitates act easy enough motivation heres go astray large spend altogether much time attempting influence move motivation levels efforts meant appeal elicit spikes someones motivation otherwise known marketing advertising promotions work tirelessly appeal customers points pleasure pain inspire hope spike fear intimate social acceptance rejection ability motivation slippery construct dr fogg proposes time better spent designing attention ability words simplifyingmaking things easier doyields desired outcomes results attempting convince audience care care comes behavior design equation ability motivation youll see motivation ability xy axes behaviors dynamically fall along ability continuum extending hard easy heres example easier make donation president obamas reelection campaign online drive house pennsylvania avenue motivation affecting behavior also visualized along spectrum dynamically ranging low high im obama fan boy know motivation sky high im leader local tea party im likely motivated benevolent obamas campaign consider motivation ability together triggering behavior someone cares easy likely produce desired outcome ive signed emails barack obama ive given indication motivation level pretty high right get email following president obamas weekly address campaign team recaps address key points weaves donation request thats easy act likelihood engaging act goes contrast received email following presidents address instead asks im exponentially less likely make donation dont ability make gift youve probably noticed obama campaign example theres tradeoff motivation ability thats visualized near degree slope xy axes dr fogg calls slope activation threshold area indicates place triggers succeed put another way thats market marketers looking people motivation ability asking havent thought market along dimensions context behavior design equation pretty helpful consider email received barack obama campaign instead underscoring salient points weekly address tying need donation lets say email promoted video address subsequently saved solicitation video case likelihood behavior occurring much lower even though may motivation fiscal ability make gift perhaps im able play video device riding quiet metra car maybe didnt time watch video example demonstrates possibility trigger ambiguous broad unable adequately drive desired end result fogg behavior theory certainly simple equation becomes much complex practice interesting experience waves understanding come go throughout first day bootcamp definitely points felt handle approach times thought obtuse exclusive dr fogg breaks equation three precepts part behavior theory easier behavior likely person motivated someone likely desired behavior happen behavior happens without trigger closing soundbites closing soundbites help reframe core principles wrote fresh precepts simplicity changes behavior break make tiny crispify bj likes say behaviors achieve outcomes contrary popular

behavior happens three things converge moment motivation ability trigger biologically psychologically humananimal parallels sometimes borderline humorous skeptical better avoid taking exit labeled shortcut get lost also cause lose customers simplicity hard simplicity changes behavior insist simplicity takeaways synthesizing thoughts blog series working way notes handouts forced organize behavior design bootcamp material way im still collecting thoughts means ive got little bit share eight behavior design takeaways takeaways center around using reinforcement shape behavior karen pryor author dont shoot dog text used studies bootcamp succinctly describes reinforcer anything occurring conjunction act tends increase probability act occur reinforcers course everywhere use day every day last points list explore related axioms foster environment praisebased reinforcement people starved success even successful among us starved feeling successful respond positive reinforcement customers likely hold high standard push days without letting jumping one task another effort measure selfimposed standard bj found feeling created winning even inconsequential disproportionately greater size accomplishment hardwire sequential progressive positive reinforcement products make someone feel like million bucks almost reinforcing facilitating celebration something consequentially quite small celebration frees people creates capacity continue toward desired outcome celebration builds motivation naturally motivation wave naturally peaks sinks troughs celebration close surefire means increasing movation day client asked get team want train motivated train theres simple answer identifying motivate paper tiger good start sole focus creating motivation treats motivation solely outcome instead element behavior design method outcome use praisebased reinforcement congratulations although research conducted bj shows brain recognizes even disingenuous congratulations effective reinforcement received computers people routinely giving outofcontext congratulations eventually condition users resent reinforcer lose capacity reinforce familiar principle interpersonal situations sales guy whos doting matter context occasion dude whos constantly pandering sucking vcs choose contextually appropriate praisebased reinforcement instead ration reinforcement psychologists call variable schedule reinforcement psychological researchers found variable schedule far effective maintaining behavior contstant predictable schedule reinforcement everything app product constantly reinforces user condition customer behavior increasingly minimal perfunctory winning time isnt really winning thus rataionale gamification uncertainty big opportunity know feeling get test question right thought shot little bit like praise happens effective reinforcing action people unsure taking instead changes account saved customer upgrades subscription service enthusiastically reinforce

painstaking work breaking things smaller bitesized pieces hard work becuase moving one many requires effort acheiving simplicity done digesting synthesizing complexity would otherwise passed user customer known create bit strife comes process design process means time time course means money equate paying process rigor required arrive delightful simplicity revise dont renege fail early often youre successfully facilitating behavior app product isnt generating results need try alternate combination motivation ability trigger although en vogue approach predates eric ries finds 20th century

entrepreneur worth salt half dozen new ideas every week great entrepreneurs constantly thinking new products marketing tactics business expansion ideas ideas great horrible problem figuring years ive selfemployed ive plenty ideas thought fantastic turned complete duds fortunately ideas resulted phenomenal success figure ideas good ones importantly figure ideas dedicate serious time money company jcd repair eightstep process figuring talk people start small make sure easy unwind make measurable scrap quickly isnt working make slightly larger investment working keep measuring aggressively pursue ideas keep working business currently employees three locations helps well customers month million sales year double sales dont say brag let know eight steps come reading book sitting classroom spending afternoon contemplation bottle wine process comes hard real world experience filled successes many mistakes case study total failure first retail location id like illustrate importance process telling one massive failures business example cost us tens thousands dollars almost put us business example things early 20kmonth sales business partner everything employees working shared office space chicago month partner working home seattle business paid month rent lean mean machine splitting 10kmonth efforts werent exactly rich things heading right direction decided time hire expand talked bunch people everyone agreed good idea got step right failed miserably step went signed three month contract upscale mall chicago area hired three employees yes thats right two guys never owned retail location employees thought would good idea triple rent expense go payroll 10kmonth payroll almost overnight next three months business partner worked doubly hard didnt take single paycheck end let two employees go drop lease three months move much less expensive location basically reboot entire chicago operation great learning experience complete financial disaster almost killed business want know done skip ahead last example saving time money even starting radio advertising months ago fixed iphone someone sold advertising local radio station repair talked business end convinced radio advertising wed trial campaign three months would cost us per month pretty significant amount money us time called business partner discuss idea fortunately hes quick learner debacle first retail location still fresh mind soon done pitching idea pointed starting small us violation step also pointed tried several offline advertising campaigns flopped however seeing incredible returns online advertising suggestion going spend advertising invest online advertising already knew working step radio advertising idea scrapped immediately cost us minute conversation quick fyi discarded ideas revisited business conditions change monthly expenses running around 1500 per month would longer violate rule something may consider future process work facebook ads early june year decided time try facebook advertising heres quick breakdown based ideas process discussed idea employees friends everyone agreed seemed like easy low risk thing try might work spent hour creating ad set daily budget cant start much smaller unwinding basically click button stop campaign added parameter link url could easily track conversions see working days spent received exactly conversion valued comparison google adwords time period cost us resulted conversions entire idea process stopped quickly step scrap isnt working great learned facebook ads us cost us took hours time learning mistakes starting new retail locations despite huge disaster first retail space knew still wanted expand business first experience made us really think hard expand much lower risk way weve come expansion solution think fits bill process implementing first iteration tell process want say one thing sometimes dont option starting super small like facebook ads sometimes start small relative term example starting fullfledged retail space costs us initial inventory equipment supplies furniture addition serious effort find location negotiate contract setup store hire train new employees lastly almost commercial landlords want commitment least months years words expensive timeconsuming process get retail space going say expansion strategy lets us start small mean relative starting actual retail shop coming gate heres test idea new store madison wi found shared office space good location near campus free parking easily accessible car set three month lease 450month option stay longer want hired single employee run store moved 5k worth inventory space bought used furniture entire setup cost us took three days work started basic online advertising campaign worked seattle chicago stores watched location become profitable second month hired second person store shown work far allowed us open six days week increased repair capacity watched sales profits continue grow two employees made decision invest time money fullscale retail location started idea open new store madison invested relatively small amount time money get started long term commitment easy unwind measurable profits encouraged us increase investment hiring second employee continued watch sales profits grow meant time grow aggressively thats stage right positive itll work extremely confident

purchase instagram facebook covered extensively sorts media outlets good reason billion lot money pay small company isnt generating revenue conversations ranged completely crazy justified purchase every conceivable tangent ive giving thought ill admit certainly completely crazy side fence think possible justifications purchase magnitude facebook purchased instagram facebook huge might understatement year facebook released new numbers amendment s1 documents update sec filing connection suspected may ipo safe say numbers quite staggering march 2012 million monthly active facebook users increase last year also million daily active users increase year prior growth impressive total number users facebook offers many services prominently used far photo sharing fact facebook dwarfs photo storage services internet put actual number million photos uploaded facebook every day isnt something immediately comes mind least didnt stop think exactly spend time browsing facebook thats right youre looking photos friends party cousins new baby long lost high school buddys wedding photo sharing aspect facebook huge reason application popular clear mobile obviously becoming larger larger market everyday secret facebook growth area extremely important million mobile users facebook certainly making headway space however think agree facebook apps lacking photo sharing viewing side things yes possible snap share photo browse photos friends experience really isnt great fact kind sucks instagram hand much enjoyable mobile photo viewing sharing experience think everyone used applications agree didnt facebook create instagram heres one place tripped right away easy see facebook would want functionality instagram part facebook mobile app instagram become popular good reason wouldnt facebook build instagram clone company certainly talent resources pull would seem like much economical way gain substantial hold mobile photo sharing market turns facebook may originally going direction last summer documents images leaked techcrunch showing something like instagram facebook would looked like nothing ever materialized facebook really wanted instagram users company realized organically growing kind usage loyalty new feature part lessthanperfect facebook app would extremely challenging impossible instagram large passionate active photo sharing community given facebooks core functionality photo sharing service certainly felt threatened little app strange think company worth upwards billion employs thousands talented folks tech community would feel threatened instagram bottom line behind mobile photo sharing space instagram company twelve people built really great simple application gained much steam quickly facebook react guess facebook realized shelved new photo product decided explore acquisition facebook instagram facebook officially owns one popular mobile photo sharing platforms want use purchase increase strength photo sharing general specifically via mobile devices question trying figure whether purchase price actually legitimate facebook pay becomes important question dont necessarily answer things consider essentially two different things done instagram features functionality become part current facebook mobile application scenario instagram know dies ends becoming acquisition talent software facebook acquired gowalla december essentially turned acquihire type scenario gowalla team ended working facebook timeline feature definitely possibility instagram team always slippery slope active users beloved service becomes part larger service lot times users leave facebook become huge could impact lot people ill throw hat ring one like see little guy well skeptical huge dominant player option essentially leave things instagram team becomes part larger facebook team essentially works separate product tighter integration facebook would likely ultimately instagram would appear isnt actually owned facebook still good chance instagram users jump ship know already even though nothing changed yet option facebook better chance maintaining current community really think facebook found appealing app first place interesting point add second potential option another huge number users exposed instagram obviously large number loyal facebook users likely interested signing yet another service share photos app part facebook people may apt try id say pretty likely app fact stays separate number new instagram users far outweigh number users bail mr zuckerberg released statement said instagram remain separate continue operate think probably best direction facebook take one im sure theyve thought long hard thought huge conglomerate starts cloud perspective definitely benefit saying instagram kept completely separate figure exactly use lets say im still little skeptical sidenote instagram doesnt actually make money essentially business model outside investment wouldnt exist current form whether facebook attempt monetize service hope added app increase overall userbase yet seen ads instagram stream sound appealing possibility still plenty questions surrounding whole instagram deal answers unfold time goes think real value facebook sees acquisition lies current instagram users result theyll quite careful handle application bottom line facebook wants find balance keeping many current instagram users possible adding many new users possible whatever company get moneys worth purchase lets honest facebook got quite bit worth prove
